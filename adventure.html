  <b> <p style="font-size: 21px;">One morning I woke up and I was alone, away from the light. It was dark and lonely. I’m very hungry but then I spot some food. My mother thinks I am very clever. Then I remember where is my mum? I cry in despair. I can hear loud noises around me. Very loud it scares me! I feel like I’m moving slowly and steadily. It has stopped. Where am I? My heart is pounding faster and faster. I am shaking again but worse is still to come. I saw some breathing holes. Suspiciously, I explore and I peep through the hole. Then something covers the holes… where am I?The next morning I wake up and hear running and screaming around me banging, crashing really loud! Then I explore my space. Again I see brown walls and a brown floor a red plate and a bowl of water. I see the covered breathing holes again the words are up-side down and little strips from the walls have been pulled of all around. Throughout my adventure and in my dreams I played a little game, a guessing game, where I guess where I might be. I guessed I might be in the supermarket with all the delicious foods of the world. Then I guess I might be at the toy store with all the toys to play with. I imagine I’m on the beach by the shore finding shells listening to the waves or even a tropical island with souvenirs and find temples or hidden treasure but when I finish the game I am back to my old brown little room.<b></p>
  <b><p style="font-size: 21px;">I always wonder when I can come out of here? Maybe a year, a month, a week or for my sake a few days I have almost run out of food in this tiny little room. The same theory that happened yesterday has started again but louder. Then after a while I get shaken my water spills then cracking loud the wrap covering the breathing holes has disappeared then I noticed something I never noticed before the roof of my room is coming up. I get so scared I try to hide but where? Then I see the light so bright in my eyes, I’m not used of the light so I cannot see then I hear gasping and yelling “A PUPPY! A PUPPY!!!” after a minute my eyes get used to the light and I can see a little girl hugging me. I see her eyes as clear as the ocean she is stroking me. “Merry Christmas” she says sweetly. Now I get it I’m a puppy for Christmas which is much better than all the dreams I had put together. Now I can see a little bowl with food and a plastic bowl with water and a glorious new kennel. As the girl strokes me her mum hands her something. The girl attaches it around my neck. I believe it’s called a “collar”. She named me spot.<b></p>
